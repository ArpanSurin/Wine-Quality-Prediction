# WINE QUALITY PREDICTION
This project is a part of my internship at **TechnoHacks Edutech** 

## Dataset Information
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
* Quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* K Neighbors Classifier
* Suport Vector Classification
* Random Forest Classifiier
* Decision Tree Classifier

**Best Model Accuracy : 90.3125**
